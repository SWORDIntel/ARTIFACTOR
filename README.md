# 🪦 ARTIFACTOR v3.0.0

### *“The Enterprise-Grade Solution To A Problem Claude Solved With ‘zip -r .’ ”*

> A lovingly over-engineered shrine to frustration,scope creep, premature optimization, and the unstoppable march of “just ask the model.”
> Now **100% redundant** and **proud of it**.(im not)

## Why Does This Exist?

I built an **enterprise artifact management platform** so you could wrangle Claude’s files like a Fortune 500 because i JUST COULDNT be bothered to copy 1 by 1 and was like i gotta automate this.

Then Claude learned the ancient spell: **“please zip the whole project.”**

Result: this repo became a **museum piece like the banana on a wall**. Enjoy the tour as much as i did making this shit(i didnt)

## Security (For Absolutely No Reason)

* ✅ **Zero Critical Vulns** — because nothing says “secure” like guarding an empty vault.
* 🔐 **JWT + RBAC** — role-based access to the void.
* 🧻 **Audit Logs** — immaculate records of nobody doing nothing.
* 🧼 **Input Validation** — we sanitized the inputs you’ll never type.

> Enterprise takeaway: **Least privilege applied to least purpose.**

---

## Performance (Of Our Feelings)

* 🚀 **76% faster APIs** — from “instant” to “still instant.”
* 📉 **50% less memory** — efficiency gains powering irrelevance.
* 🧱 **71% smaller images** — tiny containers, colossal futility.
* 📈 **650% throughput** — for the traffic that will never come.

> Benchmarks confirm: **it screams into the void louder than ever**.

## Features You Don’t Need

### Security Theatre Deluxe™

* Read-only containers, resource caps, and compliance-flavored adjectives.

### Performance Wizardry

* Redis cache warming so fast it keeps **yesterday’s nothing** hot for **today’s nobody**.

### Web Platform (v3.0)

* **FastAPI + React**, **Postgres + Redis**, **PWA**, **WebSockets**.
* AKA: an **architectural diorama** of a real product.

### Desktop App (v2.0)

* PyGUI with **Tandem Button Stability™**. Buttons that work. Unlike the market fit.

### Agent Zoo

* **SECURITY**, **MONITOR**, **DATABASE**, **API-DESIGNER**, **PLUGIN-MANAGER**…
* All coordinating to achieve **strategic superfluousness**.

## How To Use (If You Insist)

### Step 1: Accept Reality

Open Claude and say:

```
please zip the entire project for me to download
```

You’re done.
*(But if you crave pain, continue.)*

### Step 2: Launch The Monolith

```bash
docker compose up -d
open http://localhost:3000
paste-claude-url-here
watch nothing you needed happen beautifully(note:rarely works anyway)
```

### Step 3: Bask

Marvel as an **87.3% accurate classifier** categorizes the artifacts you already downloaded in one go with a 100% classification accuracy

## Installation (Because Ritual Matters)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SWORDIntel/ARTIFACTOR
cd ARTIFACTOR
./scripts/quick-env.sh   # generates secrets for your souvenir
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.optimized.yml up -d
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health  # prints 'healthy', unlike my choices
```

## Pro Tips From The Past Me

* **Version control** the zip Claude gave you. It’s the only artifact that matters.
* **Batch URLs** to feel productive while automating obsolescence.
* **Dark theme** for dramatic readings of audit logs.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Port in use**: Something else meaningful is running. Consider joining it.
* **403 from Claude**: Refresh the cookie for the tool you don’t need.
* **Slow performance**: You noticed?

---

## Roadmap (Irony Forward)

* **v3.1**: Marketplace for plugins that replace features replaced by zips.
* **v4.0**: AI that predicts when you’ll realize you should just ask Claude to zip it.

## Architecture (For Show-And-Tell)
